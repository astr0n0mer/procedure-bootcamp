### From programmer to software enginner

- Software Engineering is Programming + People Management + Time bounds.
- All decisions in Software Engineering (and in Life by extension) come with benefits and tradeoffs. You have to choose which tradeoffs are you okay living with.
- When solving a problem, think of its simplest version first, come up with a solution for this version, then build up from that point.
- When presented with a problem, never jump to coding right away; write the requirement document first, formulate an approach to solve it, then it's only a matter of converting it to code.
- Get familiar to working with black boxes in requirements as this is the most likely scenario in real-world projects.
- Always stay open to modifications to the requirements.
- If you don't express your ideas, someone else will do it; then be ready for the repercussions.
- Maintain a schedule and stay true to it.
