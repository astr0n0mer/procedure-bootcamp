### Ditch your mouse

- time spent in pointing to things
- Learn touch typing, it only gets easier from here
  - [keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) is a great starting point
  - [10fastfingers](https://10fastfingers.com/) and [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) are good alternatives
- use tools like [KeyCombiner](https://keycombiner.com/) to learn new shortcuts
- use [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) for browser shortcuts
